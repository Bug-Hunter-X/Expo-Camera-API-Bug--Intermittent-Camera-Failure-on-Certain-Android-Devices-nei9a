This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API on specific Android devices. The camera may fail to initialize or function correctly, producing limited or no error messages. This issue's root cause is difficult to pinpoint, likely due to inconsistencies in how the Camera API interacts with device-specific hardware and Android versions.

## Reproducing the Issue

Reproducing this bug is challenging due to its intermittent nature and device dependency.  The problem seems more prevalent on older or less common Android devices.

## Solution (Workaround)
